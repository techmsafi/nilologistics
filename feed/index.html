<p>Losing cargo in transit is a nightmare every importer fears. At Nilo Logistics, we want to end that. Here are three non-negotiable steps for a stress-free shipment:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The Right Address:</strong> Always double-confirm our China warehouse address before sending it to your supplier.</li>



<li><strong>The Tracking Link:</strong> As soon as your supplier ships, get that tracking number and share it with us. We can’t follow up on what we don&#8217;t know exists!</li>



<li><strong>The Follow-Up:</strong> Make it a habit to check in a few days after your consignment leaves.</li>
</ol>



<p>A little bit of proactivity ensures your goods don&#8217;t get left behind. We’re here to watch your back, but these three steps make us an unbeatable team.</p>

<p>It’s 2:50 AM in China, and while Nairobi sleeps, our team is wide awake. Why do we charge a sourcing fee? Because &#8220;finding a supplier&#8221; is only 10% of the job. The other 90% is the grind: waking up at odd hours to negotiate, visiting factories in Guangzhou, and vetting the integrity of a company before you send a single shilling.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t just find a factory; we give you their contacts and help you build a lasting relationship. Our fee is an investment in <strong>risk mitigation</strong>. We do the heavy lifting—the price negotiations and the background checks—so you can focus on growing your business. We value your time, and we ask that you value the expertise that keeps your investment safe.</p>

<p>Ever wondered where the products in our local shops come from? Most roads lead to China. With unmatched manpower and resources, it is the global hub for innovation. However, we know the &#8220;skepticism&#8221; is real. Online scammers are everywhere, and navigating platforms like Alibaba or Made-in-China can feel like a minefield.</p>





<p>We prefer direct communication. While you can speak to suppliers yourself, the &#8220;middleman&#8221; risk is high. That’s where we come in. We bridge the distance, providing a physical presence where you only have a screen. You don&#8217;t need a plane ticket to China to get factory rates—you just need the right partner to ensure what you see is exactly what you get.</p>
